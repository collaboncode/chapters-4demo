So guys, enough of simple java programs !!         
         
Let's move to one level up now.         
         
We all are comfortable with addition operator. It adds two numbers.                        
                        
Can we use this addition operator to add two whole numbers in print statement?                        
                        
Instead of printing a number, let's try to print the addition result of two numbers.
