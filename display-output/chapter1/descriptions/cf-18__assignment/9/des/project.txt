Part 8/9         
         
Print a message about how many programming tasks we have done.         


<explanation/>


In this program, the System.out.println() statement adds a new line after each message, while System.out.print() does not add a new line, allowing subsequent output to appear on the same line.         


<exerciseResult/>


Output:         
Till now, we have written java programs doing following:         
1. class declarations in a java program.         
2. main method declaration inside a class.         
3. printing texts and numbers in output.         
4. printing addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers.         
5. print statement without next line method.         
         
You will be surprised that we just coded more than 150 java programs. Wow !!
