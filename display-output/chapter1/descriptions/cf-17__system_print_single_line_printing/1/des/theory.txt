Till now, we have used below print statement for printing any number or text in output:         
         
```         
System.out.println();         
```         
         
This statement prints the given value in output and moves the cursor to the next line.         
         
For printing purpose, we have one more statement:         
         
```         
System.out.print();         
```         
         
This statement is similar to previous statement but the difference is that it does not move the cursor to next line.         
Cursor remains at the end of value printed in output.         
         
Let's explore this another variant of print statement.
