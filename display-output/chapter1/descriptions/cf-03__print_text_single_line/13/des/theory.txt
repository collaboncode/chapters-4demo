So far, we have corrected and completed the java programs printing some text as output.         
         
Now, let's be part of practice exercise.         
         
Practice exercise is a stage wise set of many programs where at each stage we would be expected to modify program as per instructions.         
         
These instructions will change at each stage and we, as programmers, will modify our program as per expectations.         
         
Be ready guys !!
